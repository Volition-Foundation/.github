# 🌌 Aurora Foundation

> _Building intelligent infrastructure for a more capable, ethical, and open future._

---

**Aurora Foundation** is a collective of builders, researchers, and engineers creating the foundations of next-generation AI. Our mission is to empower open agentic systems, modular AI architectures, and real-world intelligence aligned with human values.

We support high-leverage innovation across:

- 🧱 **AI Infrastructure** — Memory systems, RAG frameworks, tool use, model orchestration  
- 🧠 **Intelligent Agents** — REACT-based reasoning, multimodal interaction, chain-of-thought  
- 📡 **Applied Projects** — Health & fitness tech, interface experiments, research incubations  

We are the force behind systems like:

- **Volition Foundation** – AI-powered wellness, fitness, and human performance  
- **Granite Agentic Core** – Modular RAG and reasoning stack for local+cloud agents  
- **Vitalis** – Behavioral health & fitness assistant (LLM model & coaching brain)
